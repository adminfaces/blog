= AdminFaces RC21 Release
:toc:
:revdate: 2019-02-05 18:00:00 GMT-0300

We are glad to announce that AdminFaces `1.0.0-RC21` has been released!. AdminFaces is a *free, open source and premium `PrimeFaces` theme and responsive JSF `template`*.

This release brings support for PrimeFaces 7.x as well as `5.3.x` (see https://adminfaces.github.io/site/docs/latest/#legacy_classifier[legacy classifier^]), adds two new components, borderless support for datatable, a new maven archetype and much more!

 
Below are the release highlights per project:

== Maven archetypes

A new maven archetype has been published to maven central, it is the https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-starter-persistence-archetype[admin-starter-persistence-archetype^].

This archetype generates a starter project which uses https://deltaspike.apache.org/[DeltaSpike^] data, CDI and EJB for the persistence layer.

== Towards 1.0 release

For the 1.0 release we want to have AdminFaces scaffold done and the good news is that it is almost there! The work on https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-addon[AdminFaces Addon^] has progressed a lot. What is left is just scaffolding configuration and we also decided to add SpringBoot support which may delay a little bit the 1.0 release.
